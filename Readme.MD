The purpose of the program is to have a cloud database that deletes some movie information of a movie library.
With relearning the code of python I made it a dictionary and able to tell weather or not if it has that movie in the movie library as well updating wromg information to right information in that of movie ratings.

I choose this so that I can learn how to code better in python and just general have done that with only about this code of making it actually to the code limit of 100 lines of code.

# Updates 
I have spent time with writing code and becoming more better associated with that of python of learning what I must do better so that I can write better code.

I also implemented that of runtime and to search for specific information via white space of searching code to have a specific movie title in a song if not than it will display none on the terminal.




The program I choose is that of python of using that of w3Schools as the only other site I used so that of writing better code by using the information provided by w3schools.

Only other webiste I used is just to implement the video for this assignment of posting a video.

Other things added to my code is what is the best type of candy for movie watching with true and false combined with the candy shown as a joined list.

Last Website I used is that of github.com to display my movie library code to show what I have done to change making the code of my own.
